# CollectiveDecitionMakingModel

In this repo, we provide the necessary code used to regenerate the figures in the paper titled 'Collective Decision-Making Over Nonlinear Potential Fields.' Particularly,
- Figures 2(a)-(d) can be generated using:
  - computations/unbaised_undirected.m
  - computations/unbaised_balanced.m
  - computations/plot_graphs.m
- Figures 3(a)-(d) can be generated using:
  - computations/basins_bais_analysis.m
 
The necessary code corresponding to the simulation of both applications in the paper, Kapferer Tailorshop and fish schools, can be found under simulations/tailorshop and simulations/fish_schools, respectively.
